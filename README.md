# Convolutional Neural Network Project
## Overview

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation. The project leverages deep learning techniques to solve. It demonstrates the pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and provides modular code for customization.

## Features

Preprocessing:* Efficient data cleaning and augmentation.*

Model Architectur****e:* Customizable CNN architecture built using [framework/library, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.].*

Training and Validat****ion:* Robust training loop with support for metrics visualization.*

Evalu****ation:* Performance analysis with detailed metrics and visualizations.*

## Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Libraries:

[Library 1, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.]

[Library 2, e.g., NumPy, pandas, etc.]

[Library 3, e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.]

Dataset: [Details of the dataset used, e.g., CIFAR-10, custom dataset, etc.]
