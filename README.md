# Convolutional Neural Network
## Overview

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation. The project leverages deep learning techniques to solve. It demonstrates the pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and provides modular code for customization.

## Features

Preprocessing:* Efficient data cleaning and augmentation.*

Model Architectur****e:* Customizable CNN architecture built using [framework/library, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.].*

Training and Validat****ion:* Robust training loop with support for metrics visualization.*

Evalu****ation:* Performance analysis with detailed metrics and visualizations.*
